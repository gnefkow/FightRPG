<h2> What is this thing?</h2>
<hr>
<p>This is a "Battle RPG" game I'm working on for Coding Bootcamp. In it, you can choose a character, then battle the other characters</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://gnefkow.github.io/FightRPG/" target="blank">try it out here.</a></p>
<br>
<br>

<h2>How is it made?</h2>
<hr>
<p>This is a simple front-end game made with Javascript. A friend challenged me to (instead of using jQuery) code the whole thing with vanilla Javascript for practice, so, here it is!</p>
<br>
<br>

<h2>Status: Work In Progress</h2>
<hr>
<p>I'm currently working on this, so depending on when you look, it is probably in varying stages of disfunctional :D</p>

<h2> To Do's </h2>
* Draw some images
* Adjust the character powers so that everyone can win
